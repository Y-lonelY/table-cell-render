## Usage

1. do `npm install` to import some dependences
2. develop under `src/` directory（or you can modify `rollup.config.js` -> `input` to change the rule）

## API



### Develop

Actually in `example/`，i have created a React mini project by `create react app`, what you need to do is importing what you develop to the `example/node_module`

- `cd example` goto example directory
- `yarn add ../` add target file as module
- `yarn start` start the project

Attention, i have created the `npm` directory, so you can publish the npm package in this folder, so you can config the `control.sh` to do something, in this case to avoid some unless dependencies!
